# OpenSim Model

This folder contains the generic model used for analysing the raw biomechanical data, and comes from Adrian Lai et al. [SimTK Project](https://simtk.org/projects/model-high-flex). We used the lower limb only model and adapted this models marker set to match the experimental datasets.

Further information on this model can be found in the associated paper:
